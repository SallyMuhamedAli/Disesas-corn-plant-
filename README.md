## Introduction

- This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying corn plant diseases.
- It was created as a graduation project to solve a problem faced by some farmers in identifying corn plant diseases.

## Environment Setup

- You set up a working environment using the necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Data Preprocessing

- You applied some filters to the images to remove noise and enhance them.
- You resized the images to fit the model's requirements.
- You applied Gray() and Gaussian blur() filters during the data preprocessing stage.

## Model Building

- You built a multi-layered deep learning model using Keras.
- The model consists of Convolutional, Pooling, Flatten, and Dense layers.
- You used ReLU and Softmax activation functions in the different layers.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- You split the data into 75:25 train and validation sets.
- You trained the model on the training data set.
- The model achieved a high accuracy of 99% on the validation data set.

This is an excellent project, and congratulations on your achievement! If you have any questions or want to discuss any additional aspects, feel free to ask.
